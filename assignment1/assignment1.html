  	<p>The part of the essay I'm focusing on is the revenge of the old internet. In the essay it is presented that the internet offers a provocative exploration of the evolution of Facebook and its cultural implications, especially considering its decline and the rise of its “Weird Facebook” subversion. This response will focus on the section dealing with the aesthetic transformation of Facebook and the rise of “Weird Facebook” groups, emphasizing how these changes reflect the broader shifts in internet culture and critique. </p>

  	<p>In the essay, Kate argues that Facebook, was once a sleek and professional social media platform, that has now devolved into a cluttered space reminiscent of Myspace's downfall. This transformation, as noted, includes new features like colorful post backgrounds, varied reaction options, and stickers that contribute to a more chaotic aesthetic. The “Weird Facebook” groups, such as those with titles like “Please show to Jim!! HA!! HA!!” and “we are all god’s children, and he left us in a hot car, "comes off as a subversive counter to this trend. A lot of these groups embrace either a weird or ugly aesthetic, by using low-resolution images and outdated design elements to mock the platform's transformation and its older user base. </p>
	
	<p>My critique is trying to highlight an interesting cultural dynamic: as platforms age, they inevitably accumulate a certain aesthetic and user base that reflects their past rather than their present. Facebook’s has evolved from a minimalist website to a professional space that is now a cluttered, aesthetically chaotic environment, it symbolizes a broader trend where once-dominant platform has now become obsolete and is subsequently now mocked by new, younger users. The shift from a clean, streamlined interface to one now filled with “color and picture backgrounds,” “frames,” and various reaction options indicates a move towards visual and interactive excess. This transformation not only reflects Facebook's failure to retain user engagement, but it also highlights its failed attempt to adapt to shifting user expectations and technological trends. </p>
	
	<p>The rise of “Weird Facebook” groups serves as a form of cultural commentary and rebellion against the constant change in trends. These groups leverage the very elements of Facebook’s interface that have become symbols of its decline, such as poorly designed frames and outdated visual styles, so that they could counteract the critiques and mocking of the platform's evolution. By exaggerating and parodying these features, “Weird Facebook” groups highlight the absurdity and disconnect between Facebook’s original vision and its current state.  </p>
